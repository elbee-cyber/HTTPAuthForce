## HTTP Basic Authentication Bruteforcer
# This python program will take a URL that requires HTTP authentication, a wordlist and a username. The rest is explanitory.

This readme will be very short and sweet considering the program and attack in general is very simple. The program simply goes through every line in the wordlist specified, puts it in the standard base64 encoded format, and sends it with the Authorization header.
Feel free to tweak it, but do not redistribute, sell or remove credit banner. Enjoy!

**This program will not give you crowded output. =)**

Basic usage as seen below.
